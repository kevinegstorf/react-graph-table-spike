#Basics

For this React spike I have used a [Yeoman React Generator](https://github.com/newtriks/generator-react-webpack).

##Add New Content
- create a branch
- add your code
- test your code
- create a PR  

##Generators
To generate a new component in the app use:
```
yo react-webpack:component my/namespaced/components/name

```

##NPM Commands
```
# Start for development
npm start # or
npm run serve

# Start the dev-server with the dist version
npm run serve:dist

# Just build the dist version and copy static files
npm run dist

# Run unit tests
npm test

# Lint all files in src (also automatically done AFTER tests are run)
npm run lint

# Clean up the dist directory
npm run clean

# Just copy the static assets
npm run copy
```

## The chart

For the charts we will be using [chart.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs).
